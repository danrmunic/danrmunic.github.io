Gachapon
Hello! My name is Gachapon. You can use the up arrow key to continue talking to me 
Use the mouse scroll wheel to see the full dialogue box! This world is a work in progress (including the silly sprites) but feel free to look around. I'm looking to add information about Daniel's coding experience in an interactive format.
You can use the other arrow keys to move around, and space bar to jump!
